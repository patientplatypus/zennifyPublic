       How is user information handled?
    </h3>
    <br/>
    <p>
        All user information that will be shared will be shared publicly. Every attempt will be made to keep personally private. If a user wants to get a complete record of the information that is store in the database, they may do so here - they also have the option of completely deleting all personal information with the press of a button. Not a shadow delete or any trick - the users information will be purged from my databases.
